🏡 This is the central repository of the *greeNsort®* [project](https://greensort.org/index.html)  

📰 *greeNsort®* [article](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.article/)  
📖 *greeNsort®* [report](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.report/)  
🍀 *greeNsort®* [R package](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.R/) with partially novel C-algorithms and R-testbed (not tuned for fair comparison)  
🍁 *greeNsort®* [Rcpp package](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.Rcpp/) with prior art C++ algorithms (tuned, not comparable)  

🌱 *greeNsort®* algorithms are designed to make software greener  
🌿 need less runtime, energy and CO2  
🌳 need less memory hence better hardware amortization  
🔋 can save up to [4 nuclear power stations worldwide](https://greensort.org/WhyWhatHowmuch.html)  

💡 How? Better sorting algorithms in central software components  
🚂 Research method: analyzing the prior-art and  
🚀 designing and testing many innovative algorithms  
🚴 such that they are more sustainable  

🍄 we identifed poisened limiting assumptions  
🌻 designed a new theory of sorting with  
📐 new [sustainability measurements](https://greensort.org/GSF_SCI.html)  
🎨 new techniques that are simple and beautiful  
🔧 new [algorithms](https://greensort.org/portfolio.html)  that are sustainable  
🌵 and have nice [empirical results](https://greensort.org/results.html)  

🦆 [Ducksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#ducksort)  is more adaptive than [binary Quicksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#quicksort2) and more efficient than [ternary Quicksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#quicksort3)  
🦢 stable [Swansort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#swansort) has better chache-locality than conventional stable binary partitioning, and travelling [Storksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#storksort) also needs less RAM  
🐸 adaptive [Frogsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#frogsort) needs less memory than Mergesort  
🦎 semi-bi-adaptive [Geckosort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#geckosort) needs less memory than Mergesort  
🦑 bi-adaptive [Octosort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#octosort) is much more adaptive than Mergesort, and bi-adaptive [Squidsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#squidsort) also needs less RAM and beats [Timsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#timsort)  
🦚 and some more beautiful powerful algorithms  
<!-- 🦤 even the extinct Dodosort was re-surrected  -->
