🏡 This is the central <i>greeNsort®</i> repository  
🌱 <i>greeNsort®</i> makes software greener  
🌿 less runtime, energy and CO2  
🌳 less memory and better hardware amortization      
🔋 saves up to 4 nuclear power stations worldwide 

💡 How? Better sorting algorithms in central software components  
🚂 Method: analyzing the prior-art and  
🚀 designing and testing many innovative algorithms  
🚴 such that they are sustainable  

🌵 Result? A a thorny 12-year journey  
🍄 identifing poisened limiting assumptions  
🌻 desiging a new theory of sorting with  
📐 new sustainability measurements   
🎨 new methods that are simple and beautiful     
🔧 new algorithms with better trade-offs  

🦆 <a href="https://greensort.org/glossary.html#ducksort">Ducksort</a> ducks prior-art Quicksort algorithms  
🦢 plus stable Swansort and travelling Storksort  
🦎 Frogsorts, Geckosort need less memory than Mergesort  
🦑 adaptive Octosort and Squidsorts duck Timsort  
🦚 and some more beautiful powerful algorithms  
🦤 even the extinct Dodosort was re-invented
