🏡 This is the central code repository of the [*greeNsort®* project](www.greensort.org) for symmetric sustainable sorting  

📰 *greeNsort®* [article](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.article/)  
📖 *greeNsort®* [report](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.report/)  
🍀 *greeNsort®* [R package](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.R/) with partially novel C-algorithms and R-testbed (not tuned for fair comparison)  
🍁 *greeNsort®* [Rcpp package](https://github.com/greeNsort/greeNsort.Rcpp/) with prior art C++ algorithms (tuned, not comparable)  

🌱 *greeNsort®* algorithms are designed to make software greener  
🌿 need less runtime, energy and CO2  
🌳 need less memory hence better hardware amortization  
🔋 can save up to [4 nuclear power stations worldwide](https://greensort.org/WhyWhatHowmuch.html)  

💡 How? Better sorting algorithms in central software components  
🚂 Research method: analyzing the prior-art and  
🚀 designing and testing many innovative algorithms  
🚴 such that they are more sustainable  

🌵 after a thorny journey  
🍄 we identifed poisened limiting assumptions  
🌻 designed a new theory of sorting with  
📐 new [sustainability measurements](https://greensort.org/GSF_SCI.html)  
🎨 new techniques that are simple and beautiful  
🔧 new [algorithms](https://greensort.org/portfolio.html) that are sustainable  
📊 and have nice [empirical results](https://greensort.org/results.html)  

↯ [Zacksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#zacksort) and [Zucksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#zucksort) are more adaptive than [binary Quicksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#quicksort2) and more efficient than [ternary Quicksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#quicksort3)  
🦆 [Ducksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#ducksort) is more adaptive than Zacksort and Zucksort  
🦢 [Swansort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#swansort) is stable and has better chache-locality than conventional stable binary partitioning, and travelling [Storksort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#storksort) also needs less RAM  
🐸 [Frogsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#frogsort) is more adaptive, cache-friendlier and needs less memory than Mergesort  
🦎 [Geckosort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#geckosort) is semi-bi-adaptive, cache-friendlier and needs less memory than Mergesort  
🦑 [Octosort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#octosort) is full bi-adaptive, and [Squidsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#squidsort) is cache-friendlier and needs less RAM: both sort faster than [Timsort](https://greensort.org/glossary.html#timsort)  
🦚 and some more beautiful powerful algorithms  
<!-- 🦤 even the extinct Dodosort was re-surrected  -->
